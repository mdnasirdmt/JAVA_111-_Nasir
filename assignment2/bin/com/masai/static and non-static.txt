DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATIC AND NOT-STATIC

What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it with an example?


ans-
static variable is loaded in the RAM at time of class loading where non static variable is loaded in RAM after object creating of class.
we can access static variable any time but we can not access non static variable with out creating object.

class Test{
	int x=10;
	static int y=20;
	
	public static void main(String[]args){
		System.out.println(y)  // output=20
		System.out.println(x)  // error =can not access non static variable from static contex

	}

}
